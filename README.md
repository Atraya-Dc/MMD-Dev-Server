# MMD Dev Server Announcement

We at Minecraft Mod Development (MMD) are proud to announce the official opening of our modded Minecraft server for mod development testing. This server is not unlike ForgeCraft except that you (yes YOU) can submit your mod to be included in the server pack to be playtested! We are offering an active and well-maintained test environment for the community’s use. Your input is needed to help us make this what it should be. We have a well-rounded staff of admins who will try their best to make themselves available as often as possible. We plan on weekly server/pack updates, but may happen more frequently if required in the event of a game/server breaking bug. We look forward to helping keep this community alive and watching it grow.

## FAQ
Q: Is this a public server?
A: No, the server uses whitelisting and anyone may apply to be whitelisted, however, approval is at the discretion of the MMD Staff. You can apply by submitting a new issue at https://github.com/MinecraftModDevelopment/MMD-Dev-Server/issues and using the template at https://github.com/MinecraftModDevelopment/MMD-Dev-Server/blob/master/WHITELIST.md

Q: How do I submit my mod?
A: You can apply to have your mod added by submitting a new issue at https://github.com/MinecraftModDevelopment/MMD-Dev-Server/issues and using the template at https://github.com/MinecraftModDevelopment/MMD-Dev-Server/blob/master/TEMPLATE.md 

Q: Do I have to be the owner/author of a mod to submit it?
A: No, however, if you are requesting that a mod be added that you are not the author of, you must have already submitted a mod and have said mod approved.

A: No, as long as the mod you are requesting has a reason behind it, and is helpful to the testing of mods, any mod can be requested, does NOT mean it will be accepted though.

A: No, we wish to fully accommodate playtesting of your mod. If your mod depends on another mod or specifically needs to be tested with another mod, you may request that as well. We do ask that you not request mods that aren’t specifically needed to keep the pack size and server overhead at a minimum. As with whitelist requests, approval is at the discretion of the MMD Staff.

Q: I do not code, can I please play with you guys?
A: This is circumstantial. Currently we are accepting requests from mature individuals who wish to aid in the testing of the mods. We do require that you be well-versed in playing modded minecraft. We don’t have time to teach the basics of modded Minecraft.

Q: I’m a streamer/YouTuber, am I allowed to record playtesting?
A: We do welcome this, but as with the previous question, we don’t want to bloat the server with too many people playing just to play. You must keep in mind that the purpose of this server is solely for mod testing.
